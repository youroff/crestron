# Volume control for PAMP 4x100
---

PAMP 4x100 from Prodigy lineup has separate triggers to toggle mute state which is not convenient if you want to use only one button. The common solution based on Toggle symbol doesn't work cause mute state can be changed due to many internal or external reasons which are really difficult to track. So we rely on One Shot producing signal of 1 tick length.
